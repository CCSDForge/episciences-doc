    If you already have an account on HAL, you do not need to create a specific account to reach Episciences. You just have to fill in your login/password of your HAL account.

## Create an account
There are two steps to creating an account:

1. Fill in the information required to create the account in the dedicated form on the journal’s website;
2. Validate the creation of the account by clicking on the activation link received by e-mail.

On the journal’s website, click on "+ Create account" at the top right.

Fields marked with an asterisk are required.
