# Managing bibliographical references

> **Rights:** Administrator, Author, Editor, Editor in Chief, Editorial secretary

## The ‘Episciences Citations’ application
Episciences has an application for extracting bibliographic references which is called ‘Episciences Citations’.

### What is ‘Episciences Citations’?
The application automatically extracts and manually manages the bibliographic references contained in documents accepted for publication. Once validated, these references are displayed on the public pages of the documents/articles. They are also added to exports for CrossRef and ZbMath Open.

### How it works
The application extracts bibliographic references from the document’s PDF using the [Grobid](https://grobid.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ "Grobid") (GeneRation Of BIbliographic Data) tool.

### Display
Here is an example of how references taken from an article are displayed ([https://doi.org/10.46298/jtcam.10304](https://doi.org/10.46298/jtcam.10304 "See the article")).

## Managing references
Only people with document management rights (i.e: administrator, author, editor, editor-in-chief, editorial secretary) have access to this function.

Manual modification of extracted references is available for documents with the status ‘Accepted - waiting for final publication’ or ‘Published’.

To check and modify references, go to the article management page.

In the ‘Bibliographic References’ tab, click on ‘Manage’.

The ‘Episciences Citations’ application opens in a new tab.

The interface has two distinct sections:

- on the left, the PDF in preview mode ;
- on the right, the references identified and extracted automatically by Grobid.
