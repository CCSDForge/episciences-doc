To create and set up the reminders, go to: Journal management > Mail > Automatic reminders.

The automatic dunning process is based on:

+ Reminder settings.

Three types of reminder are available:
1. **Unanswered proofreader invitation**: to remind a proofreader who has not responded to an invitation;
2. **Reminder before proofreading delivery date**: to remind a proofreader who has accepted the invitation of the deadline;
3. **Reminder after proofreading delivery date**: allows you to remind a proofreader who has accepted the invitation but who has missed the deadline.

To set up, click on “Add a new reminder”. A screen appears with a list of parameters to be defined for the desired dunning types.
