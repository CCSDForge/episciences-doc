Before setting the reminders, you can set notifications sent if the article’s state changes (submitted, updated or refused).

To create and set up the reminders, go to: Journal management > Mail > Automatic reminders.

Nine types of reminder are available:
1. **Unanswered proofreader invitation**: to remind a proofreader who has not responded to an invitation;
2. **Reminder before proofreading delivery date**: to remind a proofreader who has accepted the invitation of the deadline;
3. **Reminder after proofreading delivery date**: allows you to remind a proofreader who has accepted the invitation but who has missed the deadline.
4. **Reminder before revision deadline**: to remind the author or the editorial board that the revision deadline is 
   imminent.
5. **Reminder after revision deadline**: to remind the author or the editorial board that the revision deadline is 
   outdated.
6. **Not enough reviewers**: to remind the editorial board to assign the article more reviewers. To set a minimum 
   reviews count go to Journal management > Journal > Settings > Editors settings.
7. **Article blocked in accepted state**: to remind the editors to complete the copy-editing process. 
8. **Article blocked in initial state (submitted)**: to remind the editors to accept or refuse an article after its 
   submission.
9. **Article blocked in reviewed state**: to remind the editors to accept or refuse an article after its reviewing.
